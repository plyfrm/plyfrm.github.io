		<h1>BMSSearch Artist Table</h1>
		
		<p style="color:red">
			<b>Add this page's URL to BeMusicSeeker or beatoraja to use the table.</b><br>
			<br>
			Warning: This will take up to a whole day to load in beatoraja currently due to major inefficiencies in the table parsing code. BMSeeker will take about 30 minutes to load this.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This is a difficulty table separating artists each into their own folder complete with
			all songs from each of their aliases, generated using the BMSSearch API.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Notes:<br>
			・ Some BMS entries will be missing due to random errors while querying the API. If you cannot find
			an artist or song you are looking for, this is most likely why.<br>
			・ As incredible of a resource as the site is, the data on BMSSearch isn't exactly perfect, so it
			might happen that things are miscategorised here and there. On the whole it should be very good though.
			Please visit <a href="https://bmssearch.net/artists/YUzOJO06xranC-">r's artist page</a> if you want a
			clearer idea of what I mean here.<br>
			・ I will update this every now and then but this process is not automatic and fairly time consuming, so
			it's totally possible that the table will be out of date at any given point.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Some statistics:<br>
			・ Number of unique artists included: <i>2,427</i><br>
			・ Number of bms files included: <i>95,028</i><br>
		</p>

			<b>Updates</b>
			
			<p>
				2023-12-01<br>
				Rewrote everything to fix most of the remaining problems:<br>
				・ Songs using collaborative aliases will now appear in each of the artists' folder.<br>
				・ Fixed an issue where aliases weren't properly merged.<br>
				・ Not really relevant for users but the table can now be regenerated without spamming the BMSSearch API,
				making things easier to iterate on and hopefully less heavy on BMSSearch's servers.<br>
				Remaining issues which can't really be fixed:<br>
				・ Some of the data will look a little weird due to BMSSearch's database being imperfect and the API errorring
				in unpredictable ways.<br>
				・ Still very big, beatoraja's code will need to be amended for it to be able to load it properly (reach out
				to me if you want a temporary build where this is fixed in the meantime, but it won't be compatible with IRs).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				2023-11-29<br>
				Now getting the artist list from BMSSearch directly, meaning the table should contain everything
				listed on the site. A couple downsides to this:<br>
				・ Folder names might not be perfect, although I did my best to make sure the most relevant alias is picked.<br>
				・ Collaborative aliases will only be able to appear in one of the artists' folder
				for the time being. This is due to the underlying data structure used. I might try to fix this in
				the future, but as beatoraja already refuses to show charts contained in more than one level folder
				the usefulness might be limited.<br>
				・ The table is now <b>&lt;Very Big&gt;</b> and will take a long time to load
				(turning off sync in BMSeeker is recommended).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				2023-11-27:<br>
				Changed URLs to point to the BMS's BMSSearch page and added <i>level_order</i> to the header.<br>
				Added a bunch of artists (considering getting the list of artists from BMSSearch directly
				instead of doing that manually as well but that's a lot more involved).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				2023-11-26:<br>
				Fixed the issue with unrelated artists being pulled into an artist's folder.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				2023-09-24:<br>
				Initial release.
