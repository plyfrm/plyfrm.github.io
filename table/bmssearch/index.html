		<h1>BMSSearch Artist Table</h1>
		
		<p>
			Add this page's URL to BeMusicSeeker or beatoraja to use the table.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This is a difficulty table separating artists each into their own folder, generated
			using the BMSSearch API. Note that it definitely isn't perfect given the data on
			BMSSearch isn't always reliable to begin with, as well as there being no API endpoint
			for querying an artist's BMS meaning I had to use the search endpoint and filter out
			as many junk results as I could. Beatoraja also cannot have the same BMS in multiple
			folders so collaborations will only be present on one of the participants' folder
			(I believe this works properly in BeMusicSeeker/LR2).
		</p>

			<b>Updates</b>
			
			<p>
				2023-11-27:<br>
				Changed URLs to point to the BMS's BMSSearch page and added <i>level_order</i> to the header.<br>
				Added a bunch of artists (considering getting the list of artists from BMSSearch directly
				instead of doing that manually as well but that's a lot more involved).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				2023-11-26:<br>
				Fixed the issue with unrelated artists being pulled into an artist's folder.
